## 摘要

Very little is known about sibling influences on child adjustment in non-Western communities. Therefore, this multi-informant study examined the longitudinal associations of sibling warmth and conflict with peer and academic adjustment and tested birth order and gender as moderators among Chinese families from Hong Kong, China. On two occasions separated by about 12 months, data were collected from two siblings in each of 189 families. Data were also collected from the mothers and class teachers of these siblings. At Time 1, older and younger siblings’ ages averaged 10.06 years (SD = 1.07) and 7.82 years (SD = 0.95), respectively. Among older siblings, 31% were boys, and among younger siblings, 48% were boys. At Time 1, siblings rated their warmth and conflict with each other. At Times 1 and 2, class teachers rated siblings on their peer exclusion, prosocial/communication skills, and academic performance. At Time 1, mothers rated their warmth and conflict with each sibling and provided family demographic information. Multilevel models revealed that, controlling for mother warmth and conflict and demographic factors, sibling warmth predicted increases in prosocial/communication skills and increases in academic performance, and sibling conflict predicted decreases in academic performance. Moreover, for younger boys, sibling conflict predicted increases in peer exclusion. Theoretically, findings highlighted the unique roles of sibling warmth and conflict, as related but distinct factors, in understanding the peer and academic adjustment of Chinese children. Practically, findings pointed to the utility of improving sibling relationships to promote positive child development.

Although research on family relationships and child adjustment traditionally focused on the roles of parents, a growing literature examines siblings’ roles, especially in the development of internalizing and externalizing problems ([Buist et al., 2013](#REF_c9)). Most of this work, however, has been based on families from Europe or the U.S. Even though some 20% of the world’s population lives in China alone ([United Nations, 2019](#REF_c58)) and some 45 million people live in the Chinese diaspora ([U.S. Census Bureau, 2019](#REF_c60)), we know next to nothing about how siblings may shape Chinese children’s development. Understanding sibling influences in Chinese communities is important, as sibling relationships can be targeted in parent education and family intervention to promote child development ([Feinberg et al., 2012](#REF_c23)). Moreover, as a cultural group that puts special emphasis on family harmony and group cohesion ([Chen, 2012](#REF_c16)), Chinese children may derive particular benefits from a healthful sibling relationship.

Using multi-informant, longitudinal data on two school-aged siblings from each of 189 families from Hong Kong, China, this study examined the associations of sibling warmth and conflict with peer functioning and academic performance and tested birth order and gender as moderators. Attachment theory ([Ainsworth, 1982](#REF_c2); [Bowlby, 1982](#REF_c6)) provided a foundation for our hypothesized links between sibling relationships and child adjustment, and family systems ([Minuchin, 1985](#REF_c43)) and gender socialization ([Maccoby, 1998](#REF_c38)) theories served as the basis for our predictions about the moderating roles of birth order and gender. We focused on children’s peer functioning and academic performance, as the formation of positive peer relationships and the acquisition of effective study skills are two major developmental tasks for children to accomplish during middle childhood ([McAdams & Zapata-Gietl, 2015](#REF_c39)). Moreover, helping children to fit in with their peers and do well in school remain important socialization goals in Chinese families, which continue to be influenced by Confucian values, values that place great importance on social connectedness and academic achievement ([Chen-Bouck et al., 2019](#REF_c17)). We used two different measures to index children’s social functioning—peer exclusion and prosocial/communication skills, both of which are critical developmental outcomes and strong predictors of long-term positive development ([Rubin et al., 2015](#REF_c49)). As increasing research shows, however, the absence of social problems, such as not being excluded and bullied by peers, does not necessarily mean the presence of social strengths, such as being kind and helpful to others ([Gable & Haidt, 2005](#REF_c24)). Our overarching goal was to explore the role of siblings in Chinese children’s academic and social adjustment.

## Unique Features of Sibling Relationships

Like other family relationships, sibling relationships can serve as sources of support and stress that shape child development ([Jensen et al., 2018](#REF_c30); [McHale et al., 2012](#REF_c40)). Warm and supportive interactions with siblings may involve laughter, assistance, and learning opportunities, which in turn may contribute to well-being and optimal functioning ([Jambon et al., 2019](#REF_c29); [Milevsky & Levitt, 2005](#REF_c42)). Meanwhile, conflictual and hostile interactions with siblings may involve bitterness, interference, and coercive behaviors, which in turn may lead to maladjustment and adverse development ([Bank et al., 2004](#REF_c3); [Whiteman et al., 2014](#REF_c62)). Importantly, sibling relationships are often characterized by love–hate dynamics, meaning that siblings can be playful and intimate at one moment and hurtful and violent at another ([Campione-Barr & Killoren, 2019](#REF_c13)). Evidence also shows that both sibling warmth and conflict remain high and stable across middle childhood ([Cole & Kerns, 2001](#REF_c18); [Kim et al., 2006](#REF_c32)). In other words, instead of two ends of one continuum, sibling warmth and conflict are related but distinct constructs.

Additional features of sibling relationships make it a unique and powerful developmental context. First, siblings spend substantial time together, allowing them to affect one another through repeated, voluntary and involuntary interactions ([Jensen et al., 2018](#REF_c30); [McHale et al., 2012](#REF_c40)). Moreover, as siblings are often similar (but not identical) in terms of age and life exposure, their relationships are simultaneously characterized by peer-like, egalitarian, and parent-like, hierarchical exchanges ([Dunn, 2007](#REF_c21)). Indeed, prior studies have linked sibling warmth to fewer and sibling conflict to more internalizing and externalizing problems ([Buist et al., 2013](#REF_c9)). As we elaborate below, however, whether and how sibling relationship qualities are associated with peer functioning and academic performance are less commonly examined and less well understood.

According to attachment theory ([Ainsworth, 1982](#REF_c2); [Bowlby, 1982](#REF_c6)), parent–child relationships contribute to the development of an internal working model that shapes how individuals construe social relationships in general. Individuals with less affectionate and more conflictual relationships with their parents, for example, tend to have an internal working model that disposes them to interact with others with less trust and more hostility. Later research documents that attachment relationships can be formed with other salient figures in the family, such as siblings. In fact, sibling relationships prove to be enduring bonds that have long-term implications for individual adjustment ([Kriss et al., 2014](#REF_c34)). Therefore, sibling relationship qualities may be linked to peer functioning.

Some studies have linked sibling warmth to peer competence and sibling conflict to peer problems. For example, in a cross-sectional study, Dutch adolescents with lower warmth and higher conflict with their siblings perceived themselves to be socially less competent ([Buist & Vermande, 2014](#REF_c12)). In another cross-sectional study, European American school-aged children with lower warmth and higher conflict with their siblings were rated by their teachers as less prosocial and by their classmates as less likeable ([Stormshak et al., 1996](#REF_c55)). Moreover, in a longitudinal study with primarily European American school-aged children, sibling warmth was positively linked to self-reported best friendship qualities a year later, although prior best friendship qualities were not controlled ([Yeh & Lempers, 2004](#REF_c64)). In another longitudinal study with European American adolescents, sibling warmth was linked to increases in perceived intimacy with best friends, and yet, the link was significant for second borns but not for firstborns ([Updegraff et al., 2002](#REF_c59)). Finally, in a long-term longitudinal study with European American youth, within-person variation in sibling warmth (but not conflict) was associated with within-person variation in perceived peer competence ([Kim et al., 2007](#REF_c33)). A focus on within-person variation allowed the investigators to rule out all stable confounding variables—directly assessed or not—as alternative explanations, but their nonlagged design meant that the within-person association documented was concurrent rather than longitudinal.

Inconsistent findings have also been reported, however. For example, in a cross-sectional study with school-aged children from the Netherlands, neither sibling warmth nor conflict was linked to children’s perceived peer competence ([Hakvoort et al., 2010](#REF_c27)). Also, in a cross-sectional study with Canadian preschool-aged children, sibling relationship qualities were not correlated with teacher ratings of child social withdrawal, peer acceptance, or prosocial behaviors ([Graham & Coplan, 2012](#REF_c26)). In fact, two cross-sectional studies documented negative correlations of sibling warmth with best friendship closeness and positive correlations of sibling conflict with best friendship closeness among school-aged children from Canada and the U.S. ([Mendelson et al., 1994](#REF_c41); [Stocker & Dunn, 1990](#REF_c53)). In keeping with the view that sibling attachment constitutes only one of many factors that shape child development ([Kriss et al., 2014](#REF_c34)), children might invest more in peer relationships to compensate for poorer sibling relationships.

In summary, most studies examining the links between sibling relationship qualities and peer functioning have focused on Western samples and used cross-sectional designs and self-reports, and their findings have been mixed. We extended this research by examining the longitudinal associations of sibling warmth and conflict (based on child reports) with peer exclusion and prosocial/communication skills (based on teacher reports) in a Chinese sample.

## Sibling Relationship Qualities and Academic Performance

The internal working model developed from attachment relationships shapes not only how individuals construe later social relationships but also how individuals perceive themselves ([Ainsworth, 1982](#REF_c2); [Bowlby, 1982](#REF_c6)). In particular, individuals who have poorer attachment relationships are less self-confident and less motivated to explore their environments and acquire new skills. Empirical tests of this postulate of attachment theory indicate that the self-confidence and motivation associated with positive attachment relationships have important implications for children’s learning in school ([Chen, 2017](#REF_c15)). In this way, sibling relationship qualities may be linked to academic performance.

Only a handful of studies have examined the links between sibling relationship qualities and academic outcomes. For example, in a cross-sectional study, Dutch adolescents with lower warmth and higher conflict with their siblings perceived themselves to be academically less competent ([Buist & Vermande, 2014](#REF_c12)). In another cross-sectional study, European American school-aged children with lower warmth and higher conflict with their siblings were rated by their teachers as less attentive and less able to learn in school ([Stormshak et al., 1996](#REF_c55)). Less consistent findings have also been reported. For example, although sibling warmth was concurrently correlated with school bonding (but not school grades) among African American adolescents, especially for older siblings with stronger familism values ([Soli et al., 2009](#REF_c52)), sibling conflict was not correlated with either school bonding or school grades. Moreover, sibling warmth was concurrently linked to fewer self-reported problems in school, such as skipping class, school suspension, and learning difficulties in a representative sample of adolescents from the U.S. ([Crosnoe & Elder, 2004](#REF_c20)). These links were significant for African Americans, but not for European, Mexican, or Asian Americans, however.

To further complicate the issue, one longitudinal study found that sibling warmth was not linked to academic achievement in a sample of primarily European American school-aged children ([Yeh & Lempers, 2004](#REF_c64)). Another longitudinal study even found that support from an older sibling—measured with self-reports on how often the older sibling engaged in activities with the younger sibling, helped the younger sibling with homework, took care of the younger sibling, and so on—predicted declines in academic adjustment among European and African American adolescents ([Bouchey et al., 2010](#REF_c5)). Adolescents who received more support from their older siblings attached less importance to education, rated themselves to be academically less competent, and received lower school grades over time, possibly because youth who continue to rely on their siblings’ support at a time of increasing autonomy face special learning problems.

In summary, nearly all studies examining the links between sibling relationship qualities and academic outcomes have been cross-sectional and focused on sibling warmth, and one longitudinal study suggested that sibling support might contribute to negative academic development ([Bouchey et al., 2010](#REF_c5)). We built on this research to examine the longitudinal associations linking both sibling warmth and conflict to children’s academic abilities (teachers’ reports of children’s school performance and learning skills, ranging from poor to excellent).

## Birth Order and Gender as Moderators

Theories highlight the importance of considering children’s individual characteristics, such as birth order and gender, as moderators of sibling influences. For example, family systems theory ([Minuchin, 1985](#REF_c43)) posits that, although family members are affected by one another, those with higher status (e.g., older siblings) are better able to define the overall tone of the relationship and thus have a greater impact on those with lower status (e.g., younger siblings). On the other hand, gender socialization theory ([Maccoby, 1998](#REF_c38)) posits that girls invest more in social relationships in general and thus may be more affected by family positivity and negativity compared to boys. There is evidence showing that sibling relationship qualities are more strongly associated with child adjustment among younger siblings ([Gallagher et al., 2018](#REF_c25); [Updegraff et al., 2002](#REF_c59)) and among girls ([Kim et al., 2007](#REF_c33); [Odudu et al., 2020](#REF_c65)), but contrasting findings have also been documented ([Branje et al., 2004](#REF_c7); [Buist et al., 2013](#REF_c9); [Gallagher et al., 2018](#REF_c25); [Soli et al., 2009](#REF_c52)). It is important to note, however, that nearly all studies testing birth order and gender as moderators have been conducted in the West. Therefore, we added to this work by testing the moderating roles of birth order and gender in a non-Western context.

## The Present Study

To recap, a growing body of research, based mostly on families in Europe and the U.S., has documented the unique roles of siblings in understanding child adjustment, especially internalizing and externalizing problems ([Buist et al., 2013](#REF_c9)). Comparatively, the associations of sibling relationship qualities with peer functioning and academic performance are less commonly studied and less well understood in general, not to mention in collectivistic communities like Chinese families ([Chen, 2012](#REF_c16); [Chen-Bouck et al., 2019](#REF_c17)). Expanding upon this work, we used multi-informant, longitudinal data on two school-aged siblings from each of 189 Chinese families to examine the links between sibling warmth and conflict and peer exclusion, prosocial/communication skills, and academic performance over a 12-month period. Although prior findings have been mixed, based on the attachment theory ([Ainsworth, 1982](#REF_c2); [Bowlby, 1982](#REF_c6)), we expected that sibling warmth would be associated positively with prosocial/communication skills and academic performance and negatively with peer exclusion and that sibling conflict would be associated negatively with prosocial/communication skills and academic performance and positively with peer exclusion. Furthermore, guided by theories of family systems ([Minuchin, 1985](#REF_c43)) and gender socialization ([Maccoby, 1998](#REF_c38)), we expected these associations to be stronger for younger siblings and for girls.

We controlled for mother warmth and conflict, as mothers continue to be more involved in caregiving than other adults in the family ([Lam et al., 2012](#REF_c35)), making the mother–child relationship a potent developmental context to consider when examining sibling influences ([Jensen et al., 2018](#REF_c30); [McHale et al., 2012](#REF_c40)). Also, we controlled for family size and mother education, as these factors have been linked to child peer and academic adjustment ([Bouchey et al., 2010](#REF_c5); [Kim et al., 2007](#REF_c33)). Finally, we controlled for prior levels of child adjustment, so that we could focus on longitudinal changes in peer functioning and academic performance and address some effects due to self-socialization ([Newsom, 2012](#REF_c44)).

## Method

## Participants and Procedures

Participants were two children from each of 189 Chinese families, as well as their mothers and class teachers, from Hong Kong, a megacity in China with a population of 7.39 million people. Despite its population density, the fertility rate of Hong Kong is very low. In fact, in 2015, only 23% of households in Hong Kong had children under the age of 15 years. Among these households with children, only 33% had two children and only 4% had three or more children ([Census and Statistics Department, 2016](#REF_c14)). Hong Kong was divided into 18 geographic districts. Using contact information publicly available on government websites, we faxed invitation letters to almost all elementary schools in 17 out of 18 districts (i.e., 485 schools)—we did not contact schools in the Islands District, as it consisted of remote islands that housed only about 2% of the population and had 16 schools with low enrollment numbers. We also excluded three schools that mainly served non-Chinese families and eight schools that had participated in another study conducted by our team. We then made follow-up phone calls, seeking to explain our research goals and study procedures to the school principals. We were able to talk to the office staff of 273 schools and the principals or their delegates of 63 schools. Due to time and resource constraints and assuming that each school would be able to recruit about 20 families, we ended recruitment once 10 schools agreed to participate.

Invitation letters and consent forms were sent through the 10 participating schools. Families with at least two children studying in the same school were invited to participate in a longitudinal study on family relationships and child development. If there were more than two children, the two who were older and closer in age were invited to participate. On two occasions separated by about 12 months, siblings were grouped in a classroom during school hours to complete questionnaires. The group session was supervised by research assistants and undergraduate students who helped siblings with individual items as needed and read all items to siblings who had difficulty completing questionnaires on their own. After the group sessions, we asked siblings to deliver a questionnaire to their home for their mother to complete. We also left questionnaires in each school for the class teachers of siblings to complete during their work hours. Only three families dropped out from the study at Time 2, resulting in a retention rate of 98%. At each time point, each parent and each class teacher received HK$100 (≈US$12.90) and HK$50 (≈US$6.50) as an honorarium, respectively. Children provided assent, teachers provided consent, and parents provided consent for their children and themselves. All procedures were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of The Education University of Hong Kong.

In Hong Kong, children enter elementary school at about 6 years of age. At Time 1, the ages of older and younger siblings averaged 10.06 years (SD = 1.08) and 7.82 years (SD = 0.96), respectively, and the sibling dyad age difference averaged 2.24 years (SD = 0.87). In terms of gender, 31% and 48% of older and younger siblings were boys, and 55% of sibling dyads were same gender. The average family size was 5.06 members (SD = 1.18; range = 3–11). We did not ask mothers to identify household members, which might have included parents, children, grandparents, and others. Most mothers fell between 31 and 40 years (47%) and between 41 and 50 years (48%) of age. In terms of education, 3%, 40%, 16%, and 42% of mothers had completed elementary school only, secondary school only, higher diploma or associate degree programs only, and college degree programs or above, respectively. According to [Census and Statistics Department (2016)](#REF_c14), 27% of all individuals aged between 31 and 50 years had completed college degree programs. Therefore, our sample included families that were higher in socioeconomic status than the typical household in Hong Kong.

## Measures

Two research assistants forward and backward translated the measures described below from English into Chinese. A third research assistant then joined in resolving the discrepancies and finalizing the items. Ratings for each measure were averaged, with higher scores indicating higher levels of the construct over the past year.

Sibling warmth was assessed with an 8-item measure ([Blyth & Foster-Clark, 1987](#REF_c4)). At Time 1, siblings rated their warm and supportive interactions with their target siblings (the ones participating in this study) on a 5-point scale (e.g., “How much do you share your inner feelings or secrets with your sibling?” and “How much does your brother/sister come to you for advice or support?”). Cronbach’s alphas were .80 and .75 for older and younger siblings, respectively.

Sibling conflict was assessed with a 5-item measure ([Stocker & McHale, 1992](#REF_c54)). At Time 1, siblings rated their conflictual and hostile interactions with their target siblings on a 5-point scale (e.g., “How often do you feel mad or angry at your sibling?” and “How often do you try to hurt your sibling by pushing, punching, or hitting him/her?”). Cronbach’s alphas were .82 and .75 for older and younger siblings, respectively.

Peer exclusion was assessed with a 4-item measure ([Willoughby et al., 2015](#REF_c63)). At Times 1 and 2, class teachers rated whether siblings were disliked, excluded, and bullied by their peers on a 3-point scale (e.g., “This child is left out or ignored by classmates” and “This child is teased or picked on by classmates”). At Times 1 and 2, Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .61 to .72 for older and younger siblings, respectively.

Prosocial/communication skills were assessed with a 7-item measure ([Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 1995](#REF_c19)). At Times 1 and 2, class teachers rated whether siblings were generous, helpful, and adept at communicating with their peers on a 6-point scale (e.g., “This child shares with others” and “This child expresses needs and feelings appropriately”). At Times 1 and 2, Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .92 to .95 for older and younger siblings.

Academic abilities were assessed with a 10-item measure ([DuPaul et al., 1991](#REF_c22)). At Times 1 and 2, class teachers rated siblings’ academic performance and learning abilities on a 5-point scale (e.g., “What is the quality of this child’s English reading skills?” and “How quickly does this child learn new materials or pick up novel concepts?”). At Times 1 and 2, Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .92 to .94 for older and younger siblings.

Mother warmth was assessed with an 8-item measure ([Schwarz et al., 1985](#REF_c50)). At Time 1, mothers rated their warm and supportive interactions with her two participating children on a 5-point scale (e.g., “I make my older/younger child feels better after talking over his/her worries with me” and “I tell or show my older/younger child that I like him/her just the way he/she is”). Cronbach’s alphas were .87 for both older and younger siblings.

Mother conflict was assessed with an 8-item measure adapted from [Smetana (1988)](#REF_c51). At Time 1, on a 5-point scale, mothers rated their conflict with her two participating children, in such domains as “chores,” “finances,” “daily activities,” and “regulation of activities.” Cronbach’s alphas were .78 and .83 for older and younger siblings, respectively.

Demographic information, including child birth order, gender, and age, family size, and maternal education, was provided by mothers at Time 1.

## Data Analytic Plan

Using SAS 9.3, we ran multilevel models separately for peer exclusion, prosocial/communication skills, and academic abilities ([Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002](#REF_c48)). This approach allowed us to estimate correlations between residual errors to account for our clustered design (i.e., siblings within families), include both older and younger siblings in the same model to increase statistical power, and directly test birth order as a moderator. Level 1 (child-level) included variables specific to each sibling (i.e., child birth order and gender, mother–child relationship qualities, prior levels of child adjustment, and sibling relationship qualities), whereas Level 2 (family-level) included variables shared by the two siblings (i.e., family size and mother education). Across variables, informants, and time points, less than 4% of our data were missing. The Full Information Maximum Likelihood procedures (FIML) were used to accommodate these missing data. FIML is among the most effective methods that reduce parameter estimation biases due to missing data in multilevel models ([Larsen, 2011](#REF_c36)).

To examine the longitudinal links between sibling relationship qualities and child adjustment, we estimated the main effects of sibling warmth and conflict at Time 1 on child peer exclusion, prosocial/communication skills, and academic abilities at Time 2, controlling for child factors (i.e., child birth order and gender, mother warmth and conflict at Time 1, and child adjustment at Time 1) and family factors (i.e., family size and mother education). To examine birth order and gender as moderators, we added their two-way interaction terms with sibling warmth and conflict and the three-way interaction terms involving birth order, gender, and sibling relationship qualities ([Aiken & West, 1991](#REF_c1)). To reduce multicollinearity, before the interaction terms were created, sibling warmth and conflict were centered at the sample mean, and birth order and gender were recoded, with older siblings and boys indicated by 0 and younger siblings and girls indicated by 1. Significant interaction terms were followed up by testing the effects of sibling relationship qualities separately for older and younger boys and girls. Regardless of their significance, all main effects were included in the final model. Nonsignificant interaction terms were removed, however. To further illustrate our model setup, the equations for the final model of child peer exclusion can be found in the [Appendix](#A).

## Results

## Preliminary Analyses

[Table 1](#tbl1) shows the mean values, standard deviations, and ranges of study variables. Children in our sample were generally well functioning, with older and younger siblings’ scores on the low end of the peer exclusion measure (possible range = 0–2) and on the high ends of the measures of prosocial/communication skills (possible range = 1–6) and academic abilities (possible range = 1–5). Moreover, sibling relationships were generally warm and nonconflictual, with older and younger siblings’ scores on the high end of the sibling warmth measure (possible range = 1–5) and the low end of the sibling conflict measure (possible range = 1–5). Mixed model ANOVAs were conducted to examine potential birth order (within-group) and gender (between-group) differences in sibling warmth and conflict. Although the birth order main effects F(1, 186)s = 1.09–2.34, ns and the interaction effects between birth order and gender were not significant F(1, 186)s = 0.04–0.67, ns, the gender main effects were significant for sibling warmth F(1, 84) = 5.90, p < .05 and sibling conflict F(1,84) = 10.22, p < .01—girls reported higher warmth and lower conflict (M = 3.14 and 2.26; SD = 0.76 and 0.85) than did boys (M = 2.92 and 2.56; SD = 0.76 and 0.83).

Mean Values (M), Standard Deviations (SD), and Ranges of Variables for Older (n = 189) and Younger Siblings (n = 189)

[Table 2](#tbl2) shows the correlations between study variables. Focusing on the associations of child-reported sibling relationship qualities at Time 1 with teacher-reported child adjustment at Time 2, for older siblings, sibling warmth was correlated positively with prosocial/communication skills and academic abilities and sibling conflict was correlated positively with peer exclusion and negatively with academic abilities. For younger siblings, sibling warmth was correlated positively with prosocial/communication skills and academic abilities and negatively with peer exclusion, and sibling conflict was correlated positively with peer exclusion and negatively with prosocial/communication skills and academic abilities. In other words, three of the six correlations of interest were significant and in the expected direction for older siblings, whereas five of six were so for younger siblings.

## Multilevel Models

[Table 3](#tbl3) shows the unstandardized coefficients and standard errors of the final multilevel models. Controlling for mother warmth and conflict, family size and mother education, and prior levels of child adjustment, sibling warmth predicted increases in prosocial/communication skills and academic abilities, and sibling conflict predicted decreases in academic abilities. Moreover, the three-way interaction between birth order, gender, and sibling conflict was significant for peer exclusion. Follow-up analyses indicated that sibling conflict predicted increases in peer exclusion only for younger boys (γ = .13; SE = .04; p < .01), but not for older siblings or younger girls (γ = .01–.05; SE = .04–.07; ns). No other interactions involving birth order or gender were significant.

## Sensitivity Analyses

As we had data on only two children from each family and families might have included other children, we conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the potential impact of family size—also a proxy for sibship size—on our findings. We included the two-way interactions of sibling warmth and conflict with family size in the models. None of these interactions were significant, suggesting that the associations between sibling relationship qualities and peer and academic adjustment did not differ by family size in this sample.

## Discussion

This study examined the longitudinal associations linking sibling warmth and conflict to peer functioning and academic performance and tested birth order and gender as moderators among Chinese school-aged children. In keeping with attachment theory ([Ainsworth, 1982](#REF_c2); [Bowlby, 1982](#REF_c6)), our findings indicated that sibling warmth predicted increases in prosocial/communication skills and academic performance and that sibling conflict predicted decreases in academic performance. The effect of sibling conflict on peer exclusion was significant for younger boys but not for older siblings or younger girls, a moderation pattern consistent with family systems theory ([Minuchin, 1985](#REF_c43)) but not with gender socialization theory ([Maccoby, 1998](#REF_c38)). As our predictor, outcome, and control variables were based on data from siblings, class teachers, and mothers, respectively, our findings could not be explained by common reporter variance. As we controlled for mother warmth and conflict, family size and mother education, and respective adjustment measures at Time 1, neither could our findings be explained by mother–child relationship qualities ([Jensen et al., 2018](#REF_c30); [McHale et al., 2012](#REF_c40)), characteristics that have been linked to child peer and academic adjustment ([Bouchey et al., 2010](#REF_c5); [Kim et al., 2007](#REF_c33)), or prior levels of child adjustment ([Newsom, 2012](#REF_c44)). In addition to these methodological strengths, our study was unique in that it examined sibling influences in a Chinese community—the largest ethnic group in the East and the world ([United Nations, 2019](#REF_c58); [U.S. Census Bureau, 2019](#REF_c60)) that remains underrepresented in the studies of psychology.

Theoretically, our findings pointed to the unique roles of siblings in child development. That is, siblings can be important sources of support and stress that shape child adjustment, even in a sample of well-functioning Chinese children, in the face of the prevailing influence of mothers ([Jensen et al., 2018](#REF_c30); [McHale et al., 2012](#REF_c40)). As sibling relationships are often involuntary, emotionally intense, and characterized by both egalitarian and hierarchical role behaviors ([Campione-Barr & Killoren, 2019](#REF_c13); [Dunn, 2007](#REF_c21); [Jensen et al., 2018](#REF_c30)), they may constitute a powerful developmental context in middle childhood, especially in a cultural group that puts special emphasis on family harmony and group cohesion, like Chinese families ([Chen, 2012](#REF_c16)). Practically, our findings pointed to the utility of promoting sibling warmth and reducing sibling conflict to enhance children’s peer and academic adjustment—two aspects of child development that have been underscored in Confucianism for centuries ([Chen-Bouck et al., 2019](#REF_c17)).

## Sibling Relationship Qualities and Peer Functioning

Attachment theory posits that family relationships, including sibling relationships, guide the ways children interact with others through an internal working model ([Ainsworth, 1982](#REF_c2); [Bowlby, 1982](#REF_c6); [Kriss et al., 2014](#REF_c34)). Indeed, prior studies have documented concurrent associations between sibling relationship qualities and peer functioning among European and U.S. families ([Buist & Vermande, 2014](#REF_c12), [Kim et al., 2007](#REF_c33); [Stormshak et al., 1996](#REF_c55)). Expanding upon this work, we found that sibling warmth predicted increases in prosocial/communication skills over a 12-month period, and that, for younger boys, sibling conflict predicted increases in peer exclusion. We also expanded on prior research to assess both positive and negative aspects of peer functioning. Although social strengths and problems have often been treated as two ends of one continuum, increasing evidence indicates that the absence of problems does not guarantee the presence of strengths ([Gable & Haidt, 2005](#REF_c24)). Our study contributed to this literature by documenting the unique association of sibling conflict with peer exclusion and the unique association of sibling warmth with prosocial/communication skills—a pattern consistent with a meta-analysis documenting a stronger impact of sibling conflict than warmth on child internalizing and externalizing problems ([Buist et al., 2013](#REF_c9)). However, bearing in mind some other research highlighting the relative importance of sibling warmth—compared to conflict—in understanding child internalizing and externalizing problems ([Padilla-Walker et al., 2010](#REF_c46); [Pike et al., 2005](#REF_c47)), future researchers should continue to examine the potentially distinctive links of sibling warmth and conflict with positive and negative aspects of child development.

Longitudinal studies have linked sibling warmth to positive relationship qualities with best friends ([Updegraff et al., 2002](#REF_c59); [Yeh & Lempers, 2004](#REF_c64)), whereas cross-sectional studies have linked sibling warmth to lower levels of closeness with best friends and sibling conflict to higher levels of closeness with best friends ([Mendelson et al., 1994](#REF_c41); [Stocker & Dunn, 1990](#REF_c53)). These studies may not be directly comparable to ours, as our measures of peer functioning did not distinguish between siblings’ experiences with their best friends versus other peers. As best friends and other peers may afford different interactions for and require different skills from children ([Rubin et al., 2015](#REF_c49)), future researchers should measure children’s functioning with best friends and with other peers as separate constructs to disentangle the interrelationships among interactions with siblings, best friends, and other peers.

## Sibling Relationship Qualities and Academic Performance

In accordance with attachment theory, poorer sibling relationships may have negative implications for children’s internal working models about themselves, which in turn may diminish their self-confidence and motivation to learn ([Ainsworth, 1982](#REF_c2); [Bowlby, 1982](#REF_c6); [Chen, 2017](#REF_c15)). Only a handful of studies, however, have examined the links between sibling relationship qualities and academic outcomes. Within this limited body of research, null findings were not uncommon ([Crosnoe & Elder, 2004](#REF_c20); [Soli et al., 2009](#REF_c52); [Yeh & Lempers, 2004](#REF_c64)), and one longitudinal study even found that support from an older sibling was associated with declines in perceived importance of education, perceived academic competence, and actual school grades ([Bouchey et al., 2010](#REF_c5)). Our study added to this work by showing that sibling warmth predicted increases and sibling conflict predicted decreases in academic performance. Why was support from a sibling linked to negative outcomes in [Bouchey et al.’s (2010)](#REF_c5) study but to positive outcomes in ours? As we note above, one possibility is that continued reliance on older siblings’ support in adolescence—when youth are increasingly motivated to gain independence from the family ([Rubin et al., 2015](#REF_c49))—may indicate special learning problems, as in [Bouchey et al.’s (2010)](#REF_c5) study. Another possibility is that, given their cultural emphasis on family harmony and group cohesion ([Chen, 2012](#REF_c16)), Chinese children may be able to derive particular benefits from harmonious and nonconflictual sibling exchanges, as in our study. An emerging line of research has used cultural comparative designs to collect cross-sectional data from children and adolescents in such countries as India, Turkey, and the Netherlands and examined sibling influences across different developmental periods ([Buist, Metindogan, et al., 2017](#REF_c10); [Buist, Verhoeven, et al., 2017](#REF_c11)). Cultural comparative studies that include longitudinal data from school- and adolescent-aged siblings in, for example, China and the U.S., are needed to test if sibling support is linked to child adjustment in unique ways in Chinese communities. More generally, however, longitudinal data should be collected to examine the long-term implications of sibling relationships for academic adjustment beyond childhood and adolescence, such as by linking sibling relationship qualities in childhood to college graduation in adulthood ([Sun et al., 2019](#REF_c56)).

It is worth noting that sibling warmth and conflict were both significant predictors, even controlling for each other in the same models. Taken together with our findings that sibling warmth was linked uniquely to prosocial/communication skills and sibling conflict was linked uniquely to peer exclusion, this study provided support to the notion that sibling warmth and conflict are related but distinct constructs, each playing a distinctive role in child development ([Campione-Barr & Killoren, 2019](#REF_c13)). Despite their significance, our measures of sibling warmth and conflict only captured children’s own perceptions of and contributions to their sibling relationships. Independent observations of sibling interactions may better capture the dyadic nature of sibling relationships. Moreover, global warmth and conflict alone may not provide a complete picture of sibling relationships. Additional domains to be examined in future research include disclosure, jealousy, conflict resolution, power balance, and behavioral control, all of which may contribute to child adjustment in unique ways ([Buist, Metindogan, et al., 2017](#REF_c10); [Buist, Verhoeven, et al., 2017](#REF_c11); [Killoren et al., 2008](#REF_c31); [Padilla et al., 2019](#REF_c45); [Tucker et al., 2010](#REF_c57)).

## Birth Order and Gender as Moderators

Most interaction terms involving birth order and gender were not significant, possibly suggesting that, in a community that puts special emphasis on the family ([Chen, 2012](#REF_c16)), sibling relationships are generally important in children’s development, regardless of children’s individual characteristics. The only significant interaction, however, indicated that sibling conflict was linked to increases in peer exclusion for younger boys, a pattern consistent with family systems theory positing that members with higher status may have a stronger influence in the family ([Minuchin, 1985](#REF_c43)), but not with gender socialization theory positing that girls may be more invested in and thus affected by family relationships ([Maccoby, 1998](#REF_c38)). As this pattern was detected for only one of our three outcome measures, it should be treated as hypothesis generating. One potential hypothesis to test, for example, is whether experiencing day-to-day conflict with an older sibling presents a “dual risk” for boys who are at higher risk than girls for a range of social/relational problems, including aggression, victimization, and autism spectrum disorders ([Loomes et al., 2017](#REF_c37); [van Lier et al., 2005](#REF_c61)). However, given that some studies based on European and U.S. samples also found mixed results regarding the moderating roles of birth order and gender ([Branje et al., 2004](#REF_c7); [Gallagher et al., 2018](#REF_c25); [Kim et al., 2007](#REF_c33); [Soli et al., 2009](#REF_c52)), more research based on Chinese samples is needed to conclude whether sibling influences are uniform or different for older and younger boys and girls in Chinese communities. Relatedly, in our initial attempt to examine the link between sibling relationships and individual adjustment, we focused on child individual characteristics as moderators. Future researchers should expand upon our work to examine the moderating roles of sibling dyad characteristics, such as gender composition and age differences ([Buist et al., 2013](#REF_c9); [McHale et al., 2012](#REF_c40) ), and culturally relevant constructs, such as collectivism and filial piety ([Chen, 2012](#REF_c16); [Chen-Bouck et al., 2019](#REF_c17)), in understanding sibling influences in Chinese communities.

## Limitations and Conclusions

This study had several limitations. First, despite our use of a multi-informant, longitudinal design and our elimination of several alternative explanations, causal inferences cannot be made based on correlational data. Intervention studies that use experimental designs to improve sibling relationships are needed to truly understand how sibling relationships may promote child adjustment ([Feinberg et al., 2012](#REF_c23)). Second, we faxed invitation letters to nearly all elementary schools in Hong Kong, but schools that eventually participated in our study might have served families of higher socioeconomic status, as reflected by the education backgrounds of mothers. Therefore, our findings may or may not apply to families with lower socioeconomic status. Moreover, Hong Kong is only one of the many megacities in China, and most child-rearing families in Hong Kong only have one child ([Census and Statistics Department, 2016](#REF_c14)). It remains unknown whether our findings are generalizable to Chinese families from other parts of China and the Chinese diaspora, which may have different political and economic systems and population control policies. Taken together, replications of our findings are needed with Chinese samples that are more diverse in terms of socioeconomic status, political economy, and fertility rates. Third, due to time and resource constraints, we were only able to collect data on two children from each family. However, as postulated by family systems theory ([Minuchin, 1985](#REF_c43)), each member is affected by all other members in the family. Although not many Hong Kong families had three or more children ([Census and Statistics Department, 2016](#REF_c14)), future researchers should collect data on all children from families of different sibship sizes to capture the simultaneous impact of multiple sibling on child adjustment.

Fourth, although our findings were consistent with attachment theory ([Ainsworth, 1982](#REF_c2); [Bowlby, 1982](#REF_c6)), we did not actually measure relational attachment and self-confidence. An important direction for future research is to assess how siblings construe both their social relationships and themselves as individuals and test these as mediators in the associations of sibling warmth and conflict with child peer and academic adjustment. Finally, this study sought to test whether existing theories and empirical literature pertaining to sibling relationships could be extended and generalized to a Chinese sample by examining the unique contributions of sibling warmth and conflict to peer and academic adjustment—research goals that are most compatible with variable-centered analytic approaches ([Howard & Hoffman, 2018](#REF_c28)). As warmth and conflict may co-occur in sibling relationships, some previous studies have used person-centered analytic approaches to document the implications of sibling relationship typologies for child adjustment ([Buist & Vermande, 2014](#REF_c12); [Stormshak et al., 1996](#REF_c55)). An important direction for the future research is to use both variable- and person-centered analytic approaches to examine the roles of siblings in understanding Chinese children’s well-being and development.

In the face of these limitations, our study was the first longitudinal study to test sibling influences on peer functioning and academic performance in Chinese families. Theoretically, our findings highlighted the unique contributions of sibling warmth and conflict to the development of Chinese school-aged children. Practically, our findings pointed to the utility of targeting sibling relationships in parent education and family intervention to promote positive child development in Chinese communities.
